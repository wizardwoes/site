But the personal experience of each separate person is comparatively narrow and meagre. 
If one depends on it, it is easy to fall into error – sometimes a
very serious or even disastrous error. Individuals, being carried away with faith
in the power of unity, waste their and others’ energy attempting to unite ill assorted 
and incompatible elements: for example, in politics to create a bloc
of socialists and liberals. Or, to take an opposite example, someone might fail
several times in applying the principle of ‘in unity is strength’ and become so
sceptical regarding the good of any union of heterogeneous elements that one
does not permit unification where complete agreement of particulars is absent
and therefore supports the subdivision of one’s party into factions on the basis
of theoretical nuances and petty practical divergences. The people in both
examples acknowledge that there is strength in unity, but in the interpretation,
verification, and restriction of this rule, neither of them has any support other
than *personal* experience or any criterion other than *individual* evaluation. The
wisdom of the ages, the sum of the experiences of a long line of generations,
becomes no more than a component part of a separate, individual layperson’s
homemade philosophy – a philosophy that is doomed to inaccuracy, indefiniteness, and weakness in practice.
