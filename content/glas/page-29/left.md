This affirmation of 
the *Ubermensch* is achieved not by a simple  and naive will of 
stubbornness or betise, but an augmentation of the senses. Such an 
augmentation of the sense doesn't mean today's "human enhancement"
where intagible objects or subharmonic frequencies can be
seen or heard, but a development of a sensibility that transcends the
limits of the five sense. In Nietzschean philosophy, this new 
sensibility means rapture (*Rausch*, sometimes rendered as "intoxication,"
or "ecstasy"). In rapture, the human oversteps the limitations on the
senses in everyday life. It was in this sense that Nietzsche considered art to be physiological.

When we say "augmentation," we risk moving into the *negative organology* of current transhumanist discourse on human enhancement. A negative organology is one that only augments
the "reckoning" capacity of the organic being and also undermines
judgement -- not only in the concept of the world, as Brian Cantwell
Smith described, but also in the moral and existential judgment
of good and evil. While transhumanist discourse believes that by
augmenting this "reckoning" capacity we can arrive at genuine
judgment, this effort does not escape the positive feedback loop
that characterizes modernity as a form of alcoholism.

This peril first manifests as a risk or even an aesthetic catastrophe: 
that using these technologies in artistic creation may
accelerate the poverty of sensibility and lead toward an increasing
numbness. Their emphasis on lived experience, whether immersive
or augmented, is nothing but mere consumption of excitement
and hype, and will only close our aesthetic experience by reducing
our five sense to sense data that sustain the database and algorithmic
operations. Besides exhibiting the advancement of technology
and so-called creativity, there is  complete lack of questiong. This 
silence and contradiction is also the place where art can *act out*.
The solution is open, but art has to be questioned on its capacity 
to question in response to today's aestheticization of consumerism
and politics
