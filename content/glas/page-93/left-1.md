Dying was once a public process in the life of the individual and a most exemplary one; 
think of the medieval pictures in which the deathbed has turned into a throne toward which the people press through the wide-open doors of the death house. 
In the course of modern times dying has been pushed further and further out of the perceptual world of the living. 
There used to be no house, hardly a room, in which someone had not once died. 
(The Middle Ages also felt spatially what makes that inscription on a sun dial of Ibiza, *Ultima multis* [the last day for many], significant as the temper of the times.) 

Today people live in rooms that have never been touched by death, dry dwellers of eternity, and when their end approaches they are stowed away in sanatoria or hospitals by their heirs. 
It is, however, characteristic that not only a man’s knowledge or wisdom, but above all his real life—and this is the stuff that stories are made of—first assumes transmissible form at the moment of his death.
Just as a sequence of images is set in motion inside a man as his life comes to an end—unfolding the views of himself under which he has encountered himself without being aware 
of it—suddenly in his expressions and looks the unforgettable emerges and imparts to everything that concerned him that authority which
even the poorest wretch in dying possesses for the living around him. This authority is at the very source of the story.
