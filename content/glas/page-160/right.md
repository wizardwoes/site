circuits / the goal of many white movie actors in blackface was to "pass," to act "black" in a mode believable to white audiences. / assumption that race was a transparent visual sign. 


NOTEBOOK: I talked to Julie Dash and mentioned a theme in the reviews of white film journalists who were surprised that Daughters of The Dust and The Glass Shield were not shot in a cinéma vérité style.

CHARLES BURNETT: I think what happened with The Glass Shield was that, because we had Ice Cube in there, the audience had a perception that it was a certain kind of film. It wasn’t that, so they didn’t know what kind of movie it was. They thought it was a documentary at one point, so that was discouraging. But it was based on a number of stories that were happening across the country during that period, so I wanted to capitalize on that. This sort of thing was happening all the time. Police would arrest somebody, harass them, and blame them for all sorts of crazy things. Because the police are so sacrosanct, you could say anything and you’d be guilty. There are so many people locked up in prison for 20 years for something they didn’t do, for something the prosecution knew they didn’t do. In fact something happened just recently where two brothers [Justly Johnson & Kendrick Scott] were arrested, spent 20 years in jail, and the charges [for a murder they did not commit] were just dismissed against them. So it’s an ongoing thing.

NOTEBOOK: Do you feel that the cultural obligation of making up for the lack of representation and misrepresentation in Black films affects your form? You mentioned that you felt you needed to tackle Killer of Sheep from multiple directions to get at the scope of all the issues you wanted to explore.

CHARLES BURNETT: The thing about making films about people of color is that studios don’t want the depth and dimensions that take place. You try to make it realistic and true to life and then you have people at the door saying, “No. I want it this way or that way.” They have no clue what it was like there. So you’re constantly fighting people who somehow got the ear of these producers, and you’re trying to make these movies that don’t do justice to what’s going on. So it’s constant denial, somehow or another you have to come back to that and squeeze it in, or make it acceptable to them. What happens is we’re the ones who have to answer for it. When you show these films at a festival like the Pan African Film Festival, you’re dealing with a level of intelligence, these audiences know all the history and you can’t try to pull the wool over their eyes. They’ll see right through you. There’s a lot of people in this community who know exactly what happened.
