Blackface was transformed from theatrical spectacle, then, to supposedly naturalistic makeup. 
The actor and the film did everything possible to make audiences forget that they were matching a racial impersonation. 
Maintaining and disrupting the fiction of blackness became the subject of white actress Norma Talmadge's reminiscence about making *The Octoroon*. 

As a form of protest against a director's decision:
> We [white actresses] got together in a corner and deliberately decided to do everything in our power to be thrown out of the picture. ... 
> So the three of us blackened only our faces and the front parts of our necks, and as the auction block revolved the camera registered the backs of our necks snow-white. 
> Needless to say, we were immediately dragged off the set, bawled out in very inelegant lanugage, and sent home that day with no pay checks.

Talmadge's prank reveals how important a naturalistic use of blackface was to the film and how ineffective it supposedly became when the audience could recognize the white body beneath it. 
In effect, where minstrel performers had used blackface to produce exaggerated and comic stereotypes of African Americans, the goal of many white movie actors in blackface was to "pass," to act "black" in a mode believable to white audiences. 
The seeming authenticity of blackface performance on film depended on white audiences' and actor's assumption that race was a transparent visual sign. 
The naturalization of blackface on film was significantly related to the increasingly naturalized structures of racial segregation within American culture at large. (64 QtCL)
