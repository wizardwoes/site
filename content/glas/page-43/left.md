Socrates: Let me put the matter thus: When will there be more chance of deception -- when the
difference is large or small?

Phaedrus: When the difference is small.

Socrates: And you will be less likely to be discovered in passing by degrees into the other
extreme than when you go all at once?

Phaedrus: Of course.

Socrates: He, then, who would deceive others, and not be deceived, must exactly know the
real likenesses and differences of things?

Phaedrus: He must.

Socrates: And if he is ignorant of the true nature of any subject, how can he detect the greater
or less degree of likeness in other things to that of which by the hypothesis he is ignorant?

Phaedrus: He cannot.

Socrates: And when men are deceived and their notions are at variance with realities, it is clear
that the error slips in through resemblances?

Phaedrus: Yes, that is the way.

Socrates: He then, who being ignorant of the truth aims at appearances, will only attain an art
of rhetoric which is ridiculous and is not an art at all?

Phaedrus: That may be expected.

In *Symposium*, and then in *Phaedrus*, it is said that amorous delirium
is what grants access to wisdom. And it is, of course, very important
and quite striking, not to say shocking, to see Plato – who is constantly pleading for rationality, reserve, *metron*, and against excess,
passion, lies – here appealing to delirium and excess (which is the
flip side of the *défaut*, and we must develop this point further by reading *Symposium*)
