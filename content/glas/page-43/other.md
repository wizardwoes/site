Phaedrus, the ur-text of media studies. Exaggeration? Possibly

Maybe of interest is to note that earlier in the text, Socrates and Phaedrus were discussing whether it was better to be with the lover or non-lover (and all the questions this incurs)

Sometime after this passage, they discuss the famed pharmakon.

Is the body a text? What would this do?

Is it legible or readable (as various systems of knowledge may claim)? How is the body made legible?

If the body is a text, is there an Author (as sole originator of the text, and gaurdian of Interpretation)? What happens if we assume there's one Author, or multiple Authors, or many authors?
<!-- questions -->

What is the "real likenesses and differences of" the body? of bodies? How do we know "real likenesses and differences"?

What memory supports are involved in the production of the body? 

Other texts. Other media.

What is 'deception' when it comes to a body?

Who is the deceiver? Who is the deceived? Are the deceived truly deceived? What role do the deceived play in the deception? To whom's (or what) benefit is it, to claim to be deceived? Who has to be protected from deception? What is at stake?

What are the conditions that allow us to make these questions? What are the conditions that make these questions valid, admissible for judgement?

Who is the (non-)lover of a given body? What processes produce these (non-)lovers?

"He then, who being ignorant of the truth aims at appearances, will only attain an art
of [the body] which is ridiculous and is not an art at all?"
