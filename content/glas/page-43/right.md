“Nobody accuses a cis femme of not being a woman,” you add, crossly. 
The gap between them and you is, I know, a sensitive subject. 
I think before I speak, but I want to press you a little further. 
“This is what is different about the figure of the transsexual woman in this Platonist universe. 
It is not a femininity deceiving about something else. It is deceptive about femininity. 
In cis metaphysics, you and I are a special kind of deceiver.”

“So … we’re not women who as women are deceivers, 
we are deceivers about being women at all. Sort of like double deceivers? Super-femmes!” You crack us both up.

“Precisely. You see, previously there was what’s true, 
which is Plato’s ‘idea’; and two fallen states, 
short of what’s true, which are the thing; and then 
even more fallen--the representation. The idea embodies 
truth for the Platonist. God and communism do it for 
Christians and Marxists, respectively. What is true is 
identical to itself. It allows no gap between itself 
and any aspect of itself. It is incapable of making a mere 
sign of itself. It is pure--and unrepresentable.”

I launch another move: “Okay, so this is also how a certain brand of feminism 
thinks about the figure of woman. She just is. There’s hand-waving about 
biological chromosomes, but those are things that are outside the everyday 
realm of human perception. Woman is a Platonic ideal that ‘real’ women 
just embody by default as variations upon perfection. They then inevitably 
join misogynists in their distrust of femme signs as deception, 
and the trap as the lowest deceiver of all.”

---

“As it stands, to be a transsexual woman is to be the 
scapegoat of an order of representation in which someone 
has to be held accountable for the failure of signs to be adequate to things. 
In the cis world, we’re comprehensible only as the lowest kind of deceivers. 
To the cis, we are choosing to be female. But who would choose that? 
So we must be traps, deceivers. We are even-worse things in the world.”
