By raising questions about the *secrecy* that cryptographic technologies must protect, and about the decentralization of data storage infrastructure presupposed by *distributed localization*, NextLeap argues
that, in terms of law:
1. We cannot impose *total transparency* without then falling
into the *totalitarianism of computational totalization*, which
dissolves the individual into the calculable and computable whole, where everything finds itself *reduced* to pure calculation – carried out at two thirds of the speed of light
– which would be to bring back what Alexander Zinoviev
described as the very basis of Stalinism.
2. At the same time, we cannot eliminate – and this is the
*same* question – *locality* and *localization*, which, as what
develop, if not in secret, at least in a space that is protected
and local in this sense, are the basis of what I will describe
here as *neganthropological noodiversity*.
