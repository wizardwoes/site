Hayles explores this dynamic by discussing differences in reading experiences
of analogue and digital texts. As she explains, reading a book involves
engaging with a text that exists in the fixed form prior to the moment when
reading commences. Reading a book engenders an experience very unlike
that of reading a text in the digital environment. As Hayles explains, an
electronic text does not exist anywhere in the form in which it is realized
on the screen and encountered by the reader. “In this sense,” Hayles
argues, “electronic text is more processual than print; it is performative
by its very nature.” *The text that is encountered as it is enunciated in
the performance is not the text that is authored*, the script is not simply
repeated but it generates a particular act, a particular text that follows the
instruction of the score, it repeats but does not reproduce it. The process
that takes place in the digital environment, and, similarly, in a Brechtian
enactment of an Event score, still relies on a repetition of the original, or
perhaps originary text, but this repetition derives from its transformation
rather than a repetition.
