The question of the network, as Jeremy Rifkin has shown well,
is *access*. What is important is the *filters*. The search engines that
permit the ranking of information charge those whom they reference. This is always a question of selection. 

The media deploy industrial technology for the exploitation of
consciousness, and do so through the imposition of retentional
*criteria*. This control of retentional systems where consciousness is
a market, where an hour of consciousness is worth the sum of the
advertising receipts divided by the number of viewers, has the effect of homogenizing secondary retention. And this is an essential
cause (if not the only cause) of what I call ill-being. The control
of retention implies the loss of identity, that is, of difference. Nietzsche saw very clearly this lost capacity to produce a difference
and the tendency of societies falsely named "individualistic" to
deny the exception. Our supposedly individualistic societies are in
reality perfectly conformist.
