The otaku themselves are aware of this situation. The otaku search
engine “TINAMI” launched in 1996 signifies this awareness with an
actual device (Figure 8). <sup>23</sup> To enable the user to find illustrations from tens of thousands of registered sites, this searchable database classifies
and quantifies various characteristics of otaku illustrations in detail.
The site is equipped with selectable parameters so that the user can
search for moe-elements. That is to say, the user can search for the
desired characteristics of things like “cat ears” and “maid costumes,” or
can set “the percentage of characters appearing” at more than 75 percent, “the age of character” at between 10 and 15, and “the degree of
déformé” at 5 in order to find desired characters categorized in the
database. Figure 9 shows the actual search window of “TINAMI.”

As the Internet spread and the site of otaku activities moved to the
Web during the late 1990s, search engines such as “TINAMI” began
to play a prominent role. In such an environment, the producers, like
it or not, must have been conscious of their position relative to the whole of otaku culture. As soon as the characters are created, they are
broken up into elements, categorized, and registered to a database. If
there is no appropriate classification, a new element or category simply
will be added. In this sense, the originality of an “original” character
can only exist as a simulacrum.
