can "you might be interested in..." be considered a kind of thesis?

algorithms/companies in an attempt to know us (you might be interested in...), do they open us to wonder (the unexpected?) or do they simply tunnel vision us on the easiest cases? (116, 'the evacuation of wonder')
do they let us return to the interesting later? or in the case of twitter, do we simply react and move on?
does forgetting allow us to return and re-discover why we found it interesting in the first place?



is the failure of these schemes (yes/no) that they don't provoke us to evaluate why we find something interesting? or that if they do provoke us, the reappraisal is simply turned into ad money?

or do they simply enable us to break 'the interesting' down into its elements and become database animals (124, 125), related to Otaku

a 'like' is a catch-all for many different kinds of judgements?
