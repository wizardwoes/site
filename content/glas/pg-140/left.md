I shall then suggest that ideology "acts" or "functions" in such a way that it "recruits"
subjects among the individuals (it recruits them all), or "transforms" the individuals into
subjects (it transforms them all) by that very precise operation which I have called
*interpellation* or hailing, and which can be imagined along the lines of the most
commonplace everyday police (or other) hailing: "Hey, you there!


Assuming that the theoretical scene I have imagined takes place in the street, the
hailed individual will turn round. By this mere one-hundred-and-eighty-degree physical
conversion, he becomes a *subject*. Why? Because he has recognized that the hail was
"really" addressed to him, and that "it was *really him* who was hailed" (and not someone
else). Experience shows that the practical telecommunication of hailings is such that they
hardly ever miss their man: verbal call or whistle, the one hailed always recognizes that it
is really him who is being hailed. And yet it is a strange phenomenon, and one which
cannot be explained solely by "guilt feelings," despite the large numbers who "have
something on their consciences."
