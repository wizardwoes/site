singularities, an effect and not a middle of the struggle. In the *practical* war between singular forces, the injuries must bring about
actual [*effectives*] expropriations. They must wrest from the other
the disposition of its own body, its language, must literally dislodge the other from its possessions. The field of the word [*verbe*]
does not suffice for this: “Language, explanations, promising are
not this recognition, for language is only an ideal middle (*ideale Milte*); it vanishes as it appears; it is not a real recognition, one that
remains (*bleibendes*)." The insistence is very marked: linguistic
idealism, linguisticism, these can always upsurge again—the
temptation is too strong—to sweeten or cicatrize the injury, to
make one forget that the middle of the carnage is not ideal but
"actual." “No one can prove this to the other through words, assurances, threats, or promises; for language is only the ideal existence of consciousness; here, on the contrary, actual opposites
confront one another, i.e. , absolutely opposed opposites that are
absolutely for themselves; and their relation is strictly a practical
one, it is itself actual; the middle of their recognition must itself be
actual. *Hence they must injure one another*. The fact that each posits
itself as exclusive totality in the singularity of its existence must
become actual. The violation [*Beleidigung*: outrage, rape, abuse] is
necessary."

Without this *Beleidigung* no consciousness, no desire, no relationship to the other could *posit itself*. But this breaking-in that
comes to injure the other’s proper(ty), the other's own, does not
come down to a singular initiative, to the decision of a freedom.
This breaking-in is engendered by a contradiction that inhabits the
proper itself, one's own own. The question here, since Hegel insists
above all on the possession of things, rather than of one's own body
proper, is of a contradiction in the thing itself. It is contradictory
that a thing (*Ding*) be some one's or some peoples proper(ty), their
own. "In particular each must be dislodged from its possession
(*Besitze*), for in possession there lies the following contradiction:
. . .” An exterior thing, a thing, a universal reality ofthe earth, by
essence exposed to all, cannot, without essential contradiction,
stay in the power of a singularity. The contradiction must be
resolved. It can be so only by the violent and total expropriation of
the singularity. But if this injury were the redistribution of morsels
of proprietorship, if a singular reappropriation followed, the same
contradiction would persist. So the only end possible is to put to
death singularity as such, the possession of proper(ty), of one's own,
in general. What is said here of the body in general, of the thing of
the earth, of everything that is exposed to the light, how is the
exception of one's own body proper marked in this? As visibility
and availability at least, the body proper is worked (over) by the
same contradiction, the stake[*enjeu*] of the same struggle to death.
