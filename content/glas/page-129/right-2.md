This affirmation of 
the *Ubermensch* is achieved not by a simple  and naive will of 
stubbornness or betise, but an augmentation of the senses. Such an 
augmentation of the sense doesn't mean today's "human enhancement"
where intagible objects or subharmonic frequencies can be
seen or heard, but a development of a sensibility that transcends the
limits of the five sense. In Nietzschean philosophy, this new 
sensibility means rapture (*Rausch*, sometimes rendered as "intoxication,"
or "ecstasy"). In rapture, the human oversteps the limitations on the
senses in everyday life. It was in this sense that Nietzsche considered art to be physiological.
