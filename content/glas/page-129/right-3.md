We view reality – the world of experience – as human collective practice in
all of its living content and in the entire sum of forces and resistances that
generate that content. The task of cognition consists in expediently organising
experience. Every act of organisation is carried out precisely by combining
specific elements. Consequently, it is necessary to have elements of experience
before us, and they are not merely ‘data’ given to us ‘ready-made’. They must be
singled out and isolated from the continuous flow of experience. (206)

If we completely abstract ourselves from humanity and its methods of labour
and cognition, then there would be no physical experience, no world of regular phenomena. 
There would remain only the elemental spontaneity of the
universe, which would know no laws, since it could not measure, calculate, or
communicate. In order to understand it and to master it, we are obliged once
again to *introduce* humanity, which would exert its efforts to struggle with that
spontaneity, to know it, change it, and organise it. Then, once again, we would
obtain physical experience, with its objective – i.e. socially worked-out and
socially useful – regularity. (219)
