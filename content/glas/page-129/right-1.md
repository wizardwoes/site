And I understood that significance demands frequentation, the
frequenting of a practice. One does not arrive at the significance
of a language, for example, in which one does not have a 
*sustained relation where one individuates oneself*, in a language that one does
not speak, no more than one arrives at the significance of a music
that one does not frequent assiduously---like the poetry of Mallarme, 
which gives itself only to the *patient*. 

It is *thus* that I came to impose upon myself and to 
systematically practice my disciplines, my *melete*---where I discovered that
*significance has a part essentially tied to memory*: objects and, more
generally, the "significants"---the utterances, books, signs and symbols, 
objets d'art, and all that which frames the unity of human
milieus---only appear to me as *echoes* of my memory. It is insofar
as they respond to an *expectation* of my memory, a protention, that
they can signi-fy, make *signs*, make signs *to me*. From then on it
was a question of learning to *cultivate high expectations*.
