And I understood that significance demands frequentation, the
frequenting of a practice. One does not arrive at the significance
of a language, for example, in which one does not have a 
*sustained relation where one individuates oneself*, in a language that one does
not speak, no more than one arrives at the significance of a music
that one does not frequent assiduously---like the poetry of Mallarme, 
which gives itself only to the *patient*. 

It is *thus* that I came to impose upon myself and to 
systematically practice my disciplines, my *melete*---where I discovered that
*significance has a part essentially tied to memory*: objects and, more
generally, the "significants"---the utterances, books, signs and symbols, 
objets d'art, and all that which frames the unity of human
milieus---only appear to me as *echoes* of my memory. It is insofar
as they respond to an *expectation* of my memory, a protention, that
they can signi-fy, make *signs*, make signs *to me*. From then on it
was a question of learning to *cultivate high expectations*.

This affirmation of 
the *Ubermensch* is achieved not by a simple  and naive will of 
stubbornness or betise, but an augmentation of the senses. Such an 
augmentation of the sense doesn't mean today's "human enhancement"
where intagible objects or subharmonic frequencies can be
seen or heard, but a development of a sensibility that transcends the
limits of the five sense. In Nietzschean philosophy, this new 
sensibility means rapture (*Rausch*, sometimes rendered as "intoxication,"
or "ecstasy"). In rapture, the human oversteps the limitations on the
senses in everyday life. It was in this sense that Nietzsche considered art to be physiological.

We view reality – the world of experience – as human collective practice in
all of its living content and in the entire sum of forces and resistances that
generate that content. The task of cognition consists in expediently organising
experience. Every act of organisation is carried out precisely by combining
specific elements. Consequently, it is necessary to have elements of experience
before us, and they are not merely ‘data’ given to us ‘ready-made’. They must be
singled out and isolated from the continuous flow of experience. (206)

If we completely abstract ourselves from humanity and its methods of labour
and cognition, then there would be no physical experience, no world of regular phenomena. 
There would remain only the elemental spontaneity of the
universe, which would know no laws, since it could not measure, calculate, or
communicate. In order to understand it and to master it, we are obliged once
again to *introduce* humanity, which would exert its efforts to struggle with that
spontaneity, to know it, change it, and organise it. Then, once again, we would
obtain physical experience, with its objective – i.e. socially worked-out and
socially useful – regularity. (219)
