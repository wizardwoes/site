If the interesting marks a tension between wonder and reason, increasing
in direct proportion to the acuteness of that tension, the feeling that underpins
it seems to lie somewhere between an object-oriented desire and
an object-indifferent affect. For Silvan Tomkins, for example, interest
seems to be the minimal condition of experience in general, "a necessary
condition for the formation of the perceptual world." Similarly, for
William James, interest is that without which "consciousness of every
creature would be a gray chaotic indiscriminateness, impossible for us to
even conceive." He writes:
> Millions of items of the outward order are present to my senses which never
> properly enter into my experience. Why? Because they have no interest for
> me. My experience is what I agree to attend to. Only those items which I
> notice shape my mind---without selective interest, experience is utter chaos.
> Interest alone gives accent and emphasis, light and shade, background and
> foreground---intelligible perspective, in a word. (402)
