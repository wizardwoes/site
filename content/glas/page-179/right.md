Throughout the course of these transformations you are faced with many decisions, 
the modern editing process consists of being faced with seemingly infinite options, infinite possible combinations of shots and sequences. 
It was only after exhausting every feasible option that 
I would progress onto the next section -- even when I thought I’d found the right one I’d keep going just to be certain. 
I believe that every scrap left on the cutting room floor is in some way incorporated into the final cut, 
realizing an idea doesn’t fit and abandoning it goes beyond negation - this return to square one itself is etched into the final form.
