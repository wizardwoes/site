I believe that it is more appropriate to use the image of the database to grasp this current situation. The emergence of Ayanami Rei
did not influence many authors so much as change the rules of the
*moe*-elements sustaining otaku culture. As a result, even those authors
who were not deliberately thinking of *Evangelion* unconsciously began to produce characters closely resembling Rei, using newly registered
*moe*-elements (quiet personality, blue hair, white skin, mysterious
power). Such a model is close to the reality of the late 1990s. Beyond
Rei, characters emerging in otaku works were not unique to individual
works but were immediately broken into *moe*-elements and recorded
by consumers, and then the elements reemerged later as material for
creating new characters. Therefore, each time a popular character appeared, the *moe*-element database changed accordingly, and as a result,
in the next season there were heated battles among the new generation of characters featuring new *moe*-elements.
