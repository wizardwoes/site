When the mass media target consciousnesses insofar as they are
metamarkets, spectators constitute a "primary material" for sale,
the clients are the advertisers, and through them, industry tends
to cause the adoption of behavior. The "primary material" is what
one calls the audience, a mass of consciousnesses controlled by
systems and processes for diffusing signals---that is, material states
incorporated by the said "consciousnesses" (because the information is not "immaterial," it is a transitory material state)---and
these consciousnesses are mental states engendering in their turn
motor behaviors. When audiences of this kind are synchronized,
they tend, asymptotically, to no longer constitute a *we* but rather a
*they*. I don't want to say that when you (that is, your consciousness)
watch television (and you necessarily watch it with others, at the
same time as others), you are led immediately to think the same
thing as others. I mean to say that television is a process that tends
to make you conform progressively to an average. In that average
the difference between *I* and *we* is diluted, giving the *they*, that is,
the loss of individuation of both the *I* and the *we*, at the heart of
which alone can one individuate oneself.
