At the time he submitted his report (in June 2014), Pisani-Ferry
could not have been unaware of these forecasts made by the very
institute he helped found in 2005. How did he allow himself to so dissimulate? 
The reality is that, like Greenspan, he internalized a calamitous situation 
that he continues to misunderstand thanks to a deeply
flawed analysis, thereby preventing France from taking stock of a
highly dangerous situation: '[C]ashiers, nannies, supervisors, even
teachers [...], by 2025 a third of jobs could be filled by machines,
robots or software endowed with artificial intelligence and capable
of learning by themselves. And of replacing us. This is a vision of
the future prophesied by Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president and
global head of research at Gartner.' We shall see that this 'vision' is
shared by dozens of analysts around the world - including the firm
Roland Berger, which released a study arguing that 'by 2025, 20% of
tasks will be automated. And more than three million workers may
find themselves giving up their jobs to machines. An endless list of
sectors is involved: agriculture, hospitality, government, the military
and the police.' <sup>21</sup> To conceal such prospects is a serious mistake,
noted by an associate of Roland Berger, Hakim El Karoui:
(block quote begins)
> 'The tax system is not set up to collect part of the wealth generated
> (by the digital), and the redistribution effect is therefore very limited.'
> Warning against the risk of social explosion, [El Karoui] calls for
> 'anticipating, describing, telling the truth [...], to create a shock in
> public opinion now'. Otherwise, distrust of the elites will increase, with
> serious political consequences.

Like Gorz, we think that it is not a matter of creating a third
sector out of the social and solidary economy. And we do not think
that creating a negative tax, that is, a guaranteed minimum income,
meets the challenges we face. Of course, we are not against the
social and solidary economy -- quite the contrary. Nor are we against
a guaranteed minirnum income, which we have always supported.
But we argue that in addition, we must now invent another society
founded on a contributory income, in an economy totally rethought
in contributory terms on a macroeconomic scale -- and not just in 
the non-market sector described by Rocard as an extended third sector.

The liberation of work is not a question of â€˜reducing work-time' in
order to share it out and thereby reduce the rate of unemployment:
it is a matter of eliminating unemployment by eliminating employment
as the key status and function of a macroecononic system that
was conceived and implemented by Keynes and Roosevelt but whose
effects have been reversed. Maintaining the same discourse on wage
labour and purchasing power allows those who extract profit to 
constantly exert downward pressure on the cost of labour in the employment market,
in order to increase their profits still further. Unions
have become complicit in this situation by perpetuating themselves
in the ways that Trentin and Gorz have described.
