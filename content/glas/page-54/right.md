During the course
of the twentieth century, this media had become increasingly a question of the industrial exploitation of the time of consciousness. This was
not a matter of some monstrous evolution through which a "schematics"
would migrate outside consciousness: consciousness has never been self-consciousness *other than in being projected outside itself.* But this era of
information *industries*, and especially of the analogic and numeric technologies making it possible, this exteriorized and materialized consciousness became a function of the manipulations of the flux of consciousness
and of mass projections such that, purely and simply, the annihilation
of self-consciousness through its exteriorization became a possibility for
the masses of-consumers of products and industrial lifestyles dedicated
to world markets: this gave rise to the possibility of a homogenizing synchronization of consciousnesses through temporal audiovisual objects
that quickly overran national and geographic boundaries, since the numerical is not constrained in the same way as radio broadcasting.

The nascent critique of this manipulation synchronizing consciousnesses during the age of audio*visual* and temporal objects and mass-audience industries cannot and must not be a mere denunciation of the
"de-naturing" of consciousness by cinema, but on the contrary the highlighting of the fact that consciousness functions *just like cinema*, which
has enabled cinema (and television) to take it over. Consequently, the
critique of cinema and television as social phenomena that could destroy
consciousness itself (this is the claim of "spiritual ecology") calls for a
new and different critique of consciousness, as a re-working of the Kantian project.

The "general equivalent" (i.e., money), as the basic requirement for
capital and for a market in which, through the culture industries, the
time of consciousness has itself become merchandise, is a condition of the
general equivalence of primary-secondary time in its tertiary, manipulable, storable, exchangeable, and thus saleable, spatializations. A great
weakness of Marx's project is that he did not think through this capitalistic question of retentions, especially within the context of an age of numeric culture industries that would become the very sector controlling
the industrial future in general-whether it is called the "new economy"
or not.
