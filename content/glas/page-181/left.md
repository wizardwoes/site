From this play of night, light, and leather, can I let myself take identity? How can I
recreate this roasted park in some meaningful matrix? Equipped with contradictory
visions, an ugly hand caged in pretty metal, I observe a new mechanique. I am the wild
machinist, past destroyed, reconstructing the present.

"All right." Tak spoke gently and appeasingly. "Why don't you take the rest of your
clothes off?"

"Look, I'm awfully dirty, man---" He raised his eye. "I probably stink like hell. If you
don't want-"

"I know just what you stink like," Tak said. "Go on."

He took a breath, suddenly found it funny, lay back on the hard pallet, unhooked his belt,
and closed his eyes.

He heard Tak grunt. One, then another boot, thumped the floor and fell over.

A moment later a warm hip pressed his. Palms and fingers pressed his stomach; the
fingers spread. Tak slid his hands to the jeans' waist, tugged.

Heels and shoulders pressed on the hard pad, he raised his buttocks.

Tak slid the jeans down, and---"Jesus Christ, man! What's the matter with you---that stuff
all over your dick!"

"What . . . huh?" He opened his eyes, propped his elbows under him, looked down at himself. 
"What do you . . . ?" Then he grinned. "Nothing's the matter. What's the matter with you?"

"You got dandruff in your crotch?"

"That's not dandruff. I was with a woman. Just before I met you. Only I didn't get a
chance to wash."

"Was *she* sick?"

"Naw. Didn't you ever fuck a woman?"

Tak had a strange expression. "I'll be honest: I can count the attempts on the fingers of
one hand." He narrowed his already thin mouth.

"If my God-damn *feet* don't turn you off, *that's* sure not going to hurt you!" He reached
to brush off his rough groin hair. "It's just like dried . . . come or something." The chain
glittered across it. "It happens with some women, when they're very wet. It's nothing
wrong." He stopped brushing, let himself back down on his elbows. "I bet it turns you
on."

Tak shook his head, then laughed.

"Go on," he said.

He went into the bathroom; probably laid out the same as the one he'd peed all over
upstairs. Two candles on the back of the toilet tank put two flecks on each tile; and there
was another candle up on the medicine cabinet.

He turned the taps, sat on the toilet top, and, with Newboy on his notebook, read at the
"Prologemena."

The water rushed.

After a page he skipped, reading a line here, a verse paragraph further on. At some he
laughed out loud.

He put down the book, shucked his clothing, leaned over the rim and lowered his
chained, grimy ankle. Steam kissed the sole of his foot, then hot water licked it.

Sitting in the cooling tub, chain under his buttocks, he had scrubbed only a minute
before the water was grey and covered with pale scalings.

Well, Lanya had said she wouldn't mind.

He let that water out, and ran more over his feet, rubbing the gritty skin from his insteps.
He'd known he was dirty, but the amount of filth in the water was amazing. He soaked
and soaped his hair, rubbed his arms and chest with the bar till the chain tore it. He grounded the balled washrag beneath his jaw,
and then lay back with his ears under water, to watch the isle of his belly shake to his
heart beat, each curved hair a wet scale, like the shingled skin of some amphibian.

Sometime during all this, Madame Brown's high laughter rolled into the hall; and a little
on, her voice outside the door; "No! No, you can't go in there, Muriel! Someone's taking
a bath."

He let out the water, and lay back, exhausted and clean, occasionally wiping at the tubline of grit, wider than Loufer's garrison. He pressed his back against porcelain. Water
trapped there poured around his shoulders. He sat, wondering if one could will oneself
dry. And, slowly, dried

He looked at his shoulder, peppered with pores, run with tiny lines he could imagine
separated each cell, fuzzed with dark down. He brushed his mouth on his skin, licked the
de-salted flesh, kissed it, kissed his arm, kissed the paler place where veins pushed
across the bridge from bicep to forearm, realized what he was doing, with scowling laughter, but kissed himself again. He pushed to standing. Drops trickled the back of his
legs. He was dizzy; the tiny flames wobbled in the tiles. He stepped out, heart knocking
to the sudden effort.

He toweled roughly at his hair, gently at his genitals. Then, on his knees, he did a
slightly better job washing away the hairs and grit and flaky stuff still on the bathtub
bottom.

He picked up his pants, shook his head over them; well, they were all he had. He put
them on, combed his moist hair back with his fingers, tucked in his shut, buckled on his
sandal, and came out into the hall. Behind his ears was cool, and still wet.

She picked up a rubber band from the desk and stretched her fingers inside it to slip it
over his roll. The band pulled in the fingertips: he thought a moment of his orchid. With
deliberation, as though she had reached a decision about him, she said, "The poor people
in this city---and in Bellona that pretty well means the black people---have *never* had very
much. Now they have even less." She looked at him with an expression he recognized as
a request for something he could not even name. "We have to give them---" she reached
forward-"something." The red rubber snapped on the tube. "We have to." She folded her
hands. "The other day when I saw you, I just assumed you were black. I suppose
because you're dark. Now I suspect you're not. Even so, you're still invited to come to
our services." She smiled brightly again. "Will you make an effort?"

"Oh. Yeah." He doffed the poster: He'd realized before he probably would not come to a service. Now he resolved never to return at all. "Sure. What do I owe you for ... this." One hand, in his pocket, he fingered the crumpled
bill.

"It's free," she said. "Like everything else." He said, "Oh," But his hand stayed on the
moist note.

In the foyer he stepped around the dumpy black woman in the dark coat too heavy for
the heat. She blinked at him suspiciously from under her black hat, pulled up her
shopping bag, and continued toward the office door. Between what Nightmare had said
earlier and what Reverend Taylor had just said, he found himself wondering, granted the
handful he'd seen, just where all the black people in Bellona *were*. The poster under his
arm, he hurried into the evening.
