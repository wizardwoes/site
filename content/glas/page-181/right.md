SAMUEL R. DELANY: I suspect Greg is writing there about my early
work---up through, say, Nova [1968]. But if you line all my books
together on the shelf, though that period (from '62, when at twenty 
I started publishing, to '68, when I sat back and decided to figure out
what I was really doing here) contains a lot of titles, in number of
pages the early period is only about a third of my production or less.
He says, you note, that it *used* to bug him. I wonder how much he's
bugged by it now? 

Now part of what, from my marginal position, I see as the problem is the idea of *anybody's* having to fight the fragmentation and
multicultural diversity of the world, not to mention outright oppression, by constructing something so rigid as an identity, an identity in
which there has to be a fixed and immobile core, a core that is structured to hold inviolate such a complete biological fantasy as race---whether white or black.

SAMUEL R. DELANY: (previous paragraph omitted)

The images of technology that say "SF" to most people come from
a period in which we had a very different relationship with our
technology from the one we have today. The period from the twenties through the sixties that supplies most of those SF images was
a time when there was always a bright sixteen- or seventeen-yearold around who could fix your broken radio---and later, your broken
television. He'd been building his own crystal radios and winding his
own coils since he was nine; he had his tube tester and his ampmeter,
and he'd go poking around in the back, find the dead tube, locate
the blown resister or condenser, take it out, get another one for fifty
cents or five dollars, and replace it for you with a little spit and his
own soldering iron. And, yes, he was about 85 percent white.

The black boxes of modern street technology (or the white boxes
of computer technology---not an accidental distinction, I'm sure) put
us in a very different relationship with the inner workings, however.
The kids who were the budding electronics repairmen are, today, the
computer hackers. And if you are having a software problem, yes,
often they can help you. But when the *hardware* goes---when one of
those chips gets a crack or a scratch---they're just as lost as anybody
else. And that means, at the material level, our technology is becoming more and more like magic---with a class of people who know
the incredibly complex spells and incantations needed to get the stuff
to work, but almost none of whom can get in there and fix it.

MARK DERY: And for that reason isn't its stamp legible in cyberpunk,
whose politics seem more libertarian than left? 

SAMUEL R. DELANY: Again, I'd say that locating SF in its traditions
might be helpful here. There's a certain rhetorical process that happens whenever a political argument is reduced to a dialogue: you see
it in Plato. You see it in Ayn Rand. You see it in Heinlein---I've seen
it happen in my own Nevèrÿon series.

Real political arguments go on for hours---forever---and are filled
with a lot of ums and ahs, general backtracking, and people going
over the same terrain again and again, trying to figure out what they
actually think. That's the real process of political discussion. In a
novel, however, you haven't got time to layout the whole thing, or to
portray the terribly slow way people are moved, micro step by microstep, from one position to another in the course of days, weeks, years of such arguments. On paper, you concentrate on those rare moments
in political discussions when two people who know exactly what
their own positions are present them in such a way that one, in response to a single, well-formed argument from an opponent, changes her or his mind. 

I am not a libertarian. I'm quick to say that I'm a Marxist---or, at
any rate, a Marxian. I remember how distressed I was, some years
ago, when I found that some of my Nevèrÿon stories and novels. in
which there were a couple of ironic arguments about economics, had
been taken up---briefly---by the libertarians. Indeed, if I have a major
criticism of libertarianism, as I understand it, it seems to be their belief in the fiction of precisely that sort of political argument (which
leaves everybody in a general consensus at the end---*ha*!) that has
only a literary existence. What's really wrong with the libertarians is
how intellectually clean they want their politics to be.

MARK DERY: What do you, as a gay SF author, make of K/S, or "slash,"
fanzines, in which female fans spin soft-core fantasies from the homoerotic subtext in Star Trek narratives? 

SAMUEL R. DELANY: I haven't looked at any "K/S" fanzines for seven
or eight years, at this point. Pretty much like everyone else, what I
was struck with at the time, however, was the extraordinarily high
quality of the writing in all this amateur porn---and not *all* of it "softcore" by a long shot! And the sheer amount of the stuff is impressive. (I confess, I've never heard it called "slash" before---but that may be a change from the last half-dozen years.) If the production level has
kept up since the few hundred pages of it I saw some years ago, by
this time, there must be more than enough to fill a good-sized barn
with the stuff! 

As a gay man, I confess: the several hundred pages that I went
through, for me, hard-core or soft-, were without erotic interest---just as, I suspect, most straight men's lesbian fantasies are not the
sort that excite practicing lesbians. In general, the stuff was just too
antiseptic.

Still, the "K/S" material confirmed something that I already knew
from my own life: that there are just as many heterosexual women
who are turned on by the idea of men having sex with one another as
there are heterosexual men who are turned on by the idea of women
having sex with one another---that the engines of desire are far more
complex than we usually give them credit for; and that if lesbians
and gay men didn't exist, heterosexual men and women would have
had to invent them---because they constantly do
