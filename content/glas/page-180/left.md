Furthermore, this constraint and limitation of the parameters of television broadcast to extremely
high frequencies-which frees up the field for a large bandwidth of transmission and is met with the quality of a capital's urban provincialism, its first
consequence-forces the transmitted image down a path of research for a
perfection oriented toward technical quality, i.e. toward the adoption of a high
definition. Favored by the initial circumstances, this adoption of a certain *code
of values* creates a normativity that reinforces the conditions that have contributed to it and that legitimizes them after the fact: high definition will make
the correct transmission at a great distance even more haphazard. Broadcasting in high definition will lead to the production of expensive apparatuses,
and those who build them will have to be that much more careful in how
they produce and sell this technology. High- definition technology resides at
the extreme limit of what can be commercialized and requires an enormous
amount of direct advertising to a specific public wealthy enough to afford
living in an urban area rather than a rural one. This then leads to a psychosocial morphology and dynamic that summarize and stabilize the *concept*
and *institution* of television; from the capital toward the large populated centers, guided bundles (modulated by frequency and on decimetric waves) are
sent forth that transmit programs of distraction over the countryside and
towns of a secondary order, which are powerless to participate in this starshaped network radiating from Paris. The veritable limits of the *concept* of
television are thus psycho-social; they are defined by the *closure* of a cycle of *recurrent causalities* that create a type of psycho-social interior milieu
endowed with homeostasis due to a certain internal regulation by the assimilation and disassimilation of technologies, procedures, and artists who are
recruited through commandeering and bound together by a mechanism of
self-defense comparable to that of various closed societies. Particular selfjustifying myths are put forth: the research of the sharpness of the image is
proclaimed to be more valuable than the research of color attempted by other
nations, and in order for this research to justify itself, the distinctive traits
of the French people are invoked, who are enamored with clarity and precision and detest the poor taste of color prints, considered only to be suitable
for primitives or children. Logical contradiction is accepted here, for this
thought is guided by affective and emotive themes; the superiority of sharpness over color is therefore invoked in the name of technical perfection,
whereas a simple calculation of the quantity of information required to transmit a colored image and a colorless image and an examination of the degree
of complication of the apparatuses used in both cases lead to the inverse
result.
