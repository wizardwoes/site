{{< erase >}}effacement of the sign, reversing, displacing, and dismantling it, to “reconstruct
what is always already inscribed,”<sup>70</sup> {{< /erase >}}writing by erasure as writing as tracing.
{{< erase >}}Here, {{< /erase >}}reading the blank<sup>71</sup> {{< erase >}}is as important, if not more so, than reading the
text itself. The space on the page signifies as a trace of the source text, of
that which is not there, and as a signifying structure in its own right. As
Derrida suggests, {{< /erase >}}“spacing {{< erase >}}is not a simple negativity of a lacuna but{{< /erase >}} rather
{{< erase >}}the{{< /erase >}} emergence of the mark.”<sup>72</sup> {{< erase >}}Or, as {{< /erase >}}Dworkin {{< erase >}}puts it, “rather than decrease
the signifying ability of the text by making portions of the print illegible, [...]{{< /erase >}}
erasures merely replace one set of signs with another equally significant set.”<sup>73</sup>

{{< erase >}}If, as{{< /erase >}} Derrida {{< erase >}}explains, writing is always a structure of signs under
erasure, “a gesture effacing the presence of a thing and yet keeping it legible
[...] always already inhabited by the trace of another sign which never
appears as such,”<sup>74</sup> then {{< /erase >}}the examples of writing by erasure discussed in
this chapter become an essence of what writing in general in fact represents.
{{< erase >}}Turning into an exaggerated form of a Barthesian tissue of quotations,{{< /erase >}}
writing by erasure enables writers to openly acknowledge the layers of
influence embedded in any act of writing, {{< erase >}}refuting the Romantic notions
of genius. When read in line with Derrida’s concept, the designation of the{{< /erase >}}
original texts turns into a nucleus of a plethora of possible new meanings,
replacing the provisional closure {{< erase >}}embedded in the familiar notions of a
literary work, {{< /erase >}}fixed in the materiality of print {{< erase >}}and the inherent limitations
of a bound, complete volume. A {{< /erase >}}commitment to questioning the origins of
texts---{{< erase >}}and hence their originality---allows for a shift in the approach to
the relationship between the source text and its iteration. When understood
as an expression of Derrida’s *sous rature*, “the {{< /erase >}}relationship {{< erase >}}between the
reinscribed text and the so-called original text {{< /erase >}}is not that of patency and
latency, but rather the relationship between the two palimpsests.”<sup>75</sup> {{< erase >}}Or,
as Derrida puts it, “reading [and writing] {{< /erase >}}resembles those X-ray {{< erase >}}pictures
which discover, under the epidermis of the last painting, another hidden
picture: of the same painter or another painter, no matter.”<sup>76</sup>{{< /erase >}} Moving away
from the finite nature of writing, authorship, and originality in copyright
terms, {{< erase >}}in writing erasure, as in composition *sous rature*,{{< /erase >}} “all conclusions,”
Spivak writes, “are genuinely provisional and therefore inconclusive, [...] all
origins are similarly unoriginal.”<sup>77</sup> {{< erase >}}As such {{< /erase >}}erasure{{< erase >}} as a creative technique
can be seen as {{< /erase >}}an extension of the statement,{{< erase >}} a manifestation of Goldsmith’s
uncreative writing as an expression of the open, provisional, and infinite
nature of language play that Derrida advocates. This is a language that, in
a form of an erasure of now canonized text, “bears with itself the necessity
of its own critique,” as Derrida contends, “a discourse which borrows from
a heritage the resources necessary for the deconstruction of that heritage
itself.”<sup>78</sup> The {{< /erase >}}same sense of unoriginality that does not imply a lack of
originality in aesthetic terms {{< erase >}}but{{< /erase >}} only a removal from an origin of a work or
a text---{{< erase >}}from its author---reverberates here and in my discussion of iteration
in Chapter 1. As a project committed to a reconceptualization of the value{{< /erase >}}
