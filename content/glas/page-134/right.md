So nothing happened that night. I did not choose Edward or
Debbie. Neither of them chose me. That first year at university, I
had awkward, fumbling sex with other students fresh to the city. I
could at least say that I had fucked a girl; that girl could at least say
she had been fucked. Not that anyone said such things. One just got
to carry oneself as having passed a requirement.

Gordon came from money, country money. He had been to some
private boarding school. Apparently there it was the done thing for
boys to read Oscar Wilde aloud, then quietly jerk each other off. His
dick was shorter and thicker and gave out with a jet of milky cum
that was truly satisfying to watch.
