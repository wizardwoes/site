(NOT A DIRECT COMPARISON) *Reverse Cowgirl*, I pick this one because my library is largely fuck-less and Wark's text contains a lot of fuck. I think also that what each author is trying to do (Wark/Theweleit, Wark/Hoss) is very different and that might make it easier to figure out whatever it is I am trying to figure out. i cherry picked the earliest examples i could, but there are many other examples of fuck in *Reverse Cowgirl*

how can Theweleit (sp?) claim that the passage is untrue? is it because there are no concrete details? possibly what the lack of concreteness (read 'real' as in crude, vulgar?) is *doing*?

is it a similar process as Lettow-Vorbeck being very good with names, dates, and details but failing to ever name his wife:
>> The omission of the woman's name is made all the more striking by the
fact that Lettow-Vorbeck is otherwise so good with names and dates. He
knows a multitude of people, whom he nearly always mentions by name. (pg 12)

Generally good with details, his omission (intentional or not) reveals something more. investigation columbo style 

how do these, as a source, differ functionally: diary? autobiography? memoir? autofiction? is it the expectation of an audience (or no audience)? a reader's expectation that some truth will be revealed in a tidy package?

in this case, Höss is writing an autobiography (or a deathbed confessional?) and Wark an autofiction. Theweleit reading Höss and writing. Wark reading Wark and writing. Me reading Theweleit reading Höss and Wark reading Wark and writing. You reading me reading Theweleit reading Höss and Wark reading Wark and writing and ... ? cute

How to judge if a text is 'based on experience'? How to resist the urge to mention Bogdanov in connection to the word experience? 

How to bring the body into play? is it enough to simply say an author's (in)ability to say fuck reveals whether or not they truly fuck?

How do these processes differ in other (social) mediums.

Is there an expectation that tweets are autobiographical? Will tweets even be around in 20-30 years for people to pyschoanalyze?
