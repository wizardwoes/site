Mikhaïl Xifaras has taught or reminded us<sup>2</sup> that the ‘very young
Marx',<sup>3</sup> who began by studying law and legal history with Friedrich
Carl von Savigny, wanted to turn jurisprudence into true philosophy.
But Marx's critique of what he understood as the juridical fictions
produced by what he then called the bourgeoisie - that is，by this
'revolutionarγ'<sup>4</sup> class who wanted to remove the legal right to collect
dead wood, a right to the *commons* of *feudal* origin, which, as Xifaras
shows, was for Marx a very uncomfortable reality<sup>5</sup> - ultimately led
him to denounce the formal and fictional character of law in general.

In so doing, Marx inscribed *work* at the heart of what, as the
'effective reality' of the human condition, constitutes the relations
of production through which human beings produce their ‘means 
of existence' - and thus *transform* the world rather than merely
interpreting it. *They realize it，that is, artificialize it*，by *realizing* the
organological fictions occurring in the course of what we ourselves
understand as processes of psychic, technical and social individuation.
