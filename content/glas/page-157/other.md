The so-called customs of the privileged classes are understood to mean customs contrary to the
law. Their origin dates to the period in which human history was part of natural history, and in
which, according to Egyptian legend, all gods concealed themselves in the shape of animals.
Mankind appeared to fall into definite species of animals which were connected not by equality,
but by inequality, an inequality fixed by laws.
