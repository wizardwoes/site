The forest owner has suffered by the theft of wood only insofar as the
wood has suffered, but not insofar as the law has been violated. Only the sensuously perceptible
aspect of the crime affects him, but the criminal nature of the act does not consist in the attack on
the wood as a material object, but in the attack on the wood as part of the state system, an attack on
the right to property as such, the realisation of a wrongful frame of mind.

A deputy from the knightly estate mentioned that in the neighbourhood of Cleve many wood thefts
took place merely in order to secure arrest and prison fare. Does not this deputy from the knightly
estate prove precisely what he wants to refute, namely, that people are driven to steal wood by the
sheer necessity of saving themselves from starvation and homelessness?
