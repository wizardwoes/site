I smiled at the butchness in his story. “What happened?”
	
"I'll never forget what Frank told me. He said, ‘You’re already a man, you don’t
have to prove that. You just have to prove what kind of man you want to be.’” My eyes
filled with tears,

Ben’s voice was as intimate as his smile. “What about you, Jesse? What made you
the way you are? What’s your life been about?”

In a world with any justice I would have poured out my life story to him. I would
have given him back in kind the trust he’d shown to me. But I was afraid and so I betrayed
him. “There’s not much to tell ” I said.

He blinked in disbelief. I wanted him to let it go, but he wouldn’t. He was brave
enough to bloody his head against my brick wall again. “Jesse ” he whispered, “tell
me something about you."

I was frozen with fear, unable to collect my thoughts enough to invent a story that
even appeared to reveal something about me. “There’s nothing to tell,” I told him. 1
was closed and protected. He was left naked.

The warmth drained from his face and anger rose to replace it. He was too gentle
a man to lash out at me. Like a butch, he kept it inside.

I stood up. “I’d better be going” I said. He nodded and stared at his beer bottle,
I let my hand rest for a moment on his shoulder. He would not accept the comfort or
look at me. I wanted to say, 
*Ben. I'm so sorry I hurt you. I only did it because I was scared.* 
*I didn't know men could hurt the way I do. Please let me back inside.*
But of course, I didn’t. Instead I said, “See you Monday."

I learned that strength, like height, is measured by who you’re standing next to.
I was considered a scrawny guy in the gym. That opinion was written on the faces of
men whose muscles were bigger than mine. And all the while the lifetime of cruel judgments 
about my body and my self throbbed like unhealed wounds.

Yet sometimes when I stood in front of my own minor at home, I saw a powerful
me, I couldn’t hold onto the image, though. It slipped like a globule of mercury from
under my index finger.

Maybe that was the lesson I tried to teach myself with each repetition---that power
is something qualitatively more than strength. And that the world was wrong about me.
I had a right to live.

Every day the men around me came to exercise their bodies; I came to exorcise
my demons.
