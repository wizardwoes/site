This is the point where some specious arguments may be raised
against me. My opponents will try to cast discredit on the cellars
of the combined order, because their kitchens will accumulate so
many trophies. Listen to what they have to say: 'We grant you',
they will tell me, 'that your phalanxes, your Series and your groups
can provide such an abundance of exquisite produce that even the
poor will share in it; but could you match that divine food everywhere in the globe with correspondingly fine wines, that would bear
comparison with those of Médoc, Ay, Chambertin, Rüdesheim,
Jerez, Tokay, etc.? Their vineyards, limited in size, will not be able
to provide enough for the first-class tables in three million cantons,
and so the good food of the common people will have to be washed
down with poor-quality wine, which will make for gastronomic
cacophony, as you cannot have a good meal without good wine. To
accompany a meal whose plainest dishes utterly surpass those of a
modern Apicius, everywhere would have to have wines superior to
those from our famous vineyards which occupy tiny areas of land,
and which no amount of work will ever be able to equal, as their
characteristic flavours derive from the places where they are grown,
not from the work that is put into them.' 

This objection would seem to be an awkward one, and I am
happy to pose it plainly, in order to demonstrate that the solution
to the greatest problems is mere child's play to anyone who accepts
the theory of Social Movement. Yes, in the combined order a poor
man will drink wines at his table equal to the most renowned wines
of France, Spain and Hungary; and consequently the rich will have
a choice of wines that are proportionately superior. 

Nor is this all, for I shall show that where other drinks are concerned the tables of the poor will be better provided than those of
kings are today. My examples are of three types, bitter, sweet and
acidic; they are coffee, milky drinks and lemonade, all of which will
be in every respect more exquisite than the best that kings can
obtain. Their superiority will be due to the ways they are grown,
transported and prepared, none of which can be duplicated in the
present order and which kings could not provide at any price. Do
you think coffee is grown as well as it could be in the fields of
Mocha? Are there not major errors in the way it is collected and
transported, perhaps even in its usual preparation? When you
understand the care and discernment that the grouped Series will
take over each detail you will realise that our most renowned products are infinitely far from perfection. If we add that future events
will perfect the earth's sap, and thereby refine the sap of the plants
and animals which it nourishes, it will not be surprising that the
drinks left to the poorest of men will often be superior to those of
civilised potentates.
