Whats the relation between generosity and scarity? or property?

Derrida - the gift, donation, hospitality

What does it mean to be generous as a man? To be generous with masculinity?
Does this framing mean we have to consider gender (and its many intersectional permutations) as scare? 
Not in terms of 'real men (tm) are scarce' (if they ever existed) but, the material resources that enable possible men are scare?
If a reaction to scarcity is hoarding, [something] producing miserly men?

When does generosity turn into a debt? A feeling of un-payability? Ask your neighbor to borrow a cup of masculinity?

Or does thinking along the lines of masculinity as scarcity just reinforce what we're trying to unseat? 
Can you be generous with something you do not posess? (You must first posess to be generous)
Who can posess (or is allowed to posess)? 
Does a disparity have to exist to be generous?
What happens to someone who ties their self to an idea of generosity, when generosity is no longer needed?

To say only those who are already in possession of masculinity can be generous with masculinity would be to miss something important in *Stone Butch Blues*. The work of Jess's femme lovers show as much.

Thieves, smugglers, [a third thing] show the way out? As Preciado does in *Testo Junkie: Sex, Drugs, and Biopolitics in the Pharmacopornographic Era*

Nietzsche draws a line between (heterosexual) love and property:
>Sexual love betrays itself most clearly as a lust for possession: 
>the lover desires unconditional and sole possession of the
>person for whom he longs; he desires equally unconditional
>power over the soul and over the body of the beloved; he alone
>wants to be loved and desires to live and rule in the other soul
>as supreme and supremely desirable. If one considers that this
>means nothing less than excluding the whole world from a
>precious good, from happiness and enjoyment; if one considers
>that the lover aims at the impoverishment and deprivation of all
>competitors and would like to become the dragon guarding his
>golden hoard as the most inconsiderate and selfish of all 
>"conquerors" and exploiters; if one considers, finally that to the
>lover himself the whole rest of the world appears indifferent,
>pale and worthless, and he is prepared to make any sacrifice,
>to disturb any order, to subordinate all other interests---then
>one comes to feel genuine amazement that this wild avarice and
>injustice of sexual love has been glorified and deified so much
>in all ages-indeed, that this love has furnished the concept of
>love as the opposite of egoism while it actually may be the most
>ingenuous expression of egoism.

Could a similar line be drawn for a love of masculinity (as concept)? 

Who (plural) will be the invisible biblo that defeats the dragon atop a pile of masculinity?

if the gamers could chill for one FUCKING second

All of this is maybe too much emphasis on masculinity as individual, or individual acts of generosity. (The letter from your local non-profit thanking you for your generous one time gift)

Consider Bogdanov's martian utopia:

>The blood transfusions presently performed by your medicine somehow smack of philanthropy: 
>people who have a lot of blood give some of it to others who need it desperately due to, 
>say, injuries. We, of course, do the same, but we do not stop there. Quite in keeping with the nature of 
>our entire system, our regular comradely exchanges of life extend beyond the ideological 
>dimension into the physiological one.
{{< cite-book "bogdanovRedStar1984" >}}

Why argue only for a reparative gift of masculinity (to fill a lack)? Why argue for a standard of masculinity? For some medical gate keeping? Why be fucking boring?

Put some skin in the game.

"our regular comradely exchanges of life" may also be a way out of the power dynamics present in Nietzche's thoughts. Not something we can ignore at the present, but maybe for the future?

Maintenance, regular upkeep, a process.
