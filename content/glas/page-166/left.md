As racial segregation became increasingly institutionalized, the use of black make up became a way to maintain all-white acting companies while still portraying African Americans on film. D.W. Griffith, the director of *The Birth of a Nation*, for instance, is reported to have forbidden "any 'black blood' among the players who might have to touch white actresses. Those actors were always whites in blackface."
