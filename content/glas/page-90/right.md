The violence and insecurity in which we live---as much as they
are exploited to the point of fantasy, or even deliberately manipulated---engage
above all a question of narcissism, and result from
a process of loss of individuation. It is a matter of narcissism in
the sense of someone like Richard Durn, assassin of a *we*---to assassinate members of a
municipal council, the official representatives of a *we*, is to assassinate a *we*---who suffered 
terribly from not existing, from not having, he said, a "feeling of existing." When
he looked in the mirror he saw only an immense nothing. This
was revealed by the publication of his personal diary in *Le Monde*.
Durn affirmed that he had a need to "do evil at least once in his
life, to have the feeling of existing."

Richard Durn suffered from a *structural privation of his primordial narcissistic capacities*.
I call "primordial narcissism" that structure of the psyche which is indispensable for functioning, 
that part of self-love which can sometimes become pathological, 
but without which any capacity for love would be impossible. Freud speaks of primary narcissism, 
but that is not what I am referring to. 
Primary narcissism designates infantile self-love, a precocious phase of
sexuality. Freud also speaks of secondary narcissism, which survives 
into adulthood, but this is still not primordial narcissism, which is
without doubt closer to what Lacan calls the "mirror phase.

Now, there is a primordial narcissism *of the we just as there is of
the I*: for the narcissism of my *I* to function,
there must be a narcissism of the *we* onto which it can project itself. Richard Durn,
failing to develop his narcissism, saw in the municipal council the
reality of an alterity that made him suffer, that did not return to
him any image, and he massacred it.
