This is a transitional point of view, the result of a situation in which theory
is still not sufficiently removed from practice – not sufficiently specialised –
to be able to live a completely separate, independent life. Practical people will
always be ‘naïve realists’, i.e. they accept that objects are precisely as they are
seen, perceived, and, in general, apprehended. The fetishism of naïve realism
consists in that it considers the object to exist in such a form completely independently of any human practice. The naïve realist supposes that the object *in
itself* is, for example, ‘quadrangular’, ‘two yards long’, ‘weighing three pounds’,
and does not understand that all these ‘properties’ can in no way belong to
the object ‘in itself’. Humanity, in its labour experience over millennia, had
to work out methods of comparing and defining forms, measurement, and
weight, in order to make ‘quadrangles’, ‘yards’, ‘pounds’, etc. possible. In nature
itself – in the instances of elemental resistance which labouring effort comes
up against – there are no such things, nor can there be. They are the result
of the activity of humanity in overcoming, changing, forming, and organising
these resistances. In the hands of fetishists – theoreticians who lock themselves
up in their studies and whose narrow specialties have almost nothing to do
with the resistance of material objects – this distortion develops further. Their
sense of isolation from material objects and their sense of the ‘independence’
of material objects are considerably deeper. They believe that such objects not
only exist independently from themselves but that they are so independent
as to be completely inaccessible to their minds; only their ‘outward appearance’ is accessible – masks which they put on before the observer. And a feeling
of their individual powerlessness – their personal passivity in relation to the
external world – reinforces in them the conviction that this ‘outward appearance’ is entirely the result of *the object’s* action on them, that they themselves
only ‘apprehend’ that action.
