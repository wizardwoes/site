Generalized automatization leads to the industrial development of robotics, but
this is not just a matter of “Ambient Computing” that produces a robotized living space in which, little by little, I no longer have anything to do (I no longer
need to open doors, order food supplies and so on) and progressively lose all
my knowledge of how to do things and how to live. It *also* involves the robotization of bots, which means, for example, that on Wikipedia, such bots shape
the work of contributors—like you and me, when, not content just to read the
entries contained in this encyclopedia, we happen to correct them, or even to
create them. Here, a new individual and collective autonomy is made possible
through a technological and automatic heteronomy.
