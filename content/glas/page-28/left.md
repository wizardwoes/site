spirit's relation to self, (2) as the circular path of a return to self. And in the description of the spirit that returns to irself through its own proper product, after it lost itself there, rhere is more than a simple rhetorical convenience in giving to the spirit rhe name father. Likewise, the advent of the Christian Trinity is more rhan an empiric event in the spirit's history.

mediation: the return (close) by self that over- comes the division and the loss. The relief of the two in(to) the three, unity's self-return. The father divides himself, goes out of himself into his son, recognizes himself in the son, and finds himself again, recounts himself in his revenue

"The root (*Wurzel*) of human nature is that man can think of himself as an *ego* (*Ich*). As a spirit, man does not have an immediate existence but is essentially returned-home-to--self (*in sich Zurückgekehrtes*). This movement of mediation (*Vermittelung*) is an essential moment of the spirit. Its activity consists in transcending and negating its immediacy so as to return upon itself (*Rückkehr in sich*); it has therefore made itself what it is by means of its own activity. Only the retumed-home-to-self is subject, real actuality. Spirit exists only as its own result. The example of the seed (*die Vorstellung des Samens dienen*) may help to illustrate [or clarify: *zur Erläuterung*] this point.  The plant begins with the seed, but the seed is also the result of the plant's entire lire, for it develops only in order to produce (*hervorzubringen*) the seed. We can see from this how impotent life is (*die Ohnmacht des Lebens*), for the seed is both the origin and the result of the individual; as the starting point and the end result, it is different and yet the same, the product of one individual and the beginning of another. Its two sides fall asunder like the simple form (*Form*) within the grain [of wheat: *Korn*] and the whole course of the plant's development.

"Every individual has an example (*Beispiel*) even closer to hand in the shape of his own person. Man is what he should be only through educarion [formation, culture: *Bildung*] and discipline (*Zucht*); what he is immediately is only the possibility of being (that is, of being rational, free), only the desrination (*Bestimmung*), obligation. The animal's formation is soon complete (*fertig*); but this should nor be seen as a blessing bestowed on the animal by nature. Its growth (*Wachstum*) is merely a quantitative increase in strength (*Erstarken*). Man, on the other hand, must make himself what he should be; he must first acquire everything for himself, precisely because he is spirit; in short he must throw off the natural. Spirit, therefore, is irs own proper result." Dialectical paradox: natural living being, life as nature devel-ops by itself without freedom insofar as its self-mobility is finite. It does not go out of itself, it does nothing but develop the germ: the quantitative increase without interruption, without relation to the outside and the absolute other. As natural necessity following its
