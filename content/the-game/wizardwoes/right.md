wizardwoes, the game, started as half a joke.

A combination of a need for a new project and nothing new to say. I decided to reproduce wizardwoes, the blog, or atleast pages of it.

This was after I had read Marczewska's *This is Not a Copy*.

Method of reproduction:
* Manual typing 
* Script(s) to convert pages of the site (html/css) to the various parts of a Godot project (text scene / gd script)
* https://github.com/wizardwoes/html_to_tscn

A webpage and a scene are both trees so whats the worst that could happen? You just walk one tree and create another.

A fool's errand, but mostly bogged down by standard project decision making. Where should X go? Which part is responsible for Y? At what point in the process do I know information Z?

QA - there has got to be an easier way of checking every page is vaguely correct.

Attempting to do styling at the same time we generate Nodes is probably making it harder than it should be. Parsing @media selectors could be easier too.

All of these are solvable problems, it just depends on how much time I want to devote to them versus reading or writing.

Eventually I decided to stop reproducing the content of wizardwoes, the blog.
