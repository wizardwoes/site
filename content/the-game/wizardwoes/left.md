wizardwoes, the blog, started as half a joke.

a combination of a need for a new project and nothing new to say. so i decided to reproduce Derrida's (and Hegel and Genet) *Glas*/*Clang*, or atleast pages of it.

this was before I had read Marczewska's *This is Not a Copy*.

method of reproduction:
* manual typing 
* copy and pasting from a pdf (still required quite a bit of clean up)

eventually I decided to stop reproducing the content of *Glas*/*Clang* but continue with the form ~every inset required manual tweaking, every italics manual, everything manual manual~. 
Derrida decided there was some value in placing Hegel and Genet next to each other, why not continue with other writers and other sources? ~i had spent too much time getting the blog set up to throw it out~
