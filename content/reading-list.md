# current
- {{< cite-book "thompsonMakingEnglishWorking1966" >}}
- The Grand Titration

# past
## 2022
- Marx's Ecology
- Gamer Theory

## 2021
- {{< cite-book "huiArtCosmotechnics2021" >}}

## 2020
- book go here

## why?
- less a flex and more a personal history
- show importance based on number of times cited?
- confirm that you are in fact, a big stiegler head

## future ideas
- entries could link to where books are actually cited
- change form to one of those word clouds where size of entry would be related to number of times cited
