- The Foundation Pit
- Culture and Society

## why?
- less a flex and more a personal history
- show importance based on number of times cited? 
- show blind spots (who is not being cited)?
- confirm that you are in fact, a big stiegler head

## future ideas
- entries could link to where books are actually cited
- change form to one of those word clouds where size of entry would be related to number of times cited
- how to include not-books?
