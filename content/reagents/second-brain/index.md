in an attempt to make this site more useful to myself, i decided on a re-structuring

in re-structuring the site it becomes a matter of re-organizing knowledge

in re-evaluating my personal criteria of selection

---

part of this was initiated by reading [link to blog]

in starting this process i notice blogs/posts about this topic more. these are usually written from a tech worker point of view, with a focus on productivity (either personal or professional)

marketing for these announces "A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential"

is it simply a way to functionalize knowledge?

a summary of one just sounds like the work place, how to become a project manager of the personal

a (personal) second brain

the core of it seems alright, but then its wrapped up in the language of financialization
"to create value"
"return on attention"
"see valuable returns"

the mythical state of "flow"

reducing all the friction does what? makes the act [what is it] easier, but what about everything else

we need "clear goals" and "instant feedback"
where is the uncertainty

sell - any exchange of value, collaboration, teach others

read it like Hui (recursion with no end)?
