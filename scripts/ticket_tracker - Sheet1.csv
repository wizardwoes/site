the rules of writing and speech,hey socrates can you work with Phaedrus on this? ,467,468 (half way),let us talk,which is divorced,260,unresolved,story,critical,Phaedr,Soc,,,,"Phaedr. Let us talk. 

Soc. Shall we discuss the rules of writing and speech as we were 
proposing?

Phaedr. Very good. 

Soc. In good speaking should not the mind of the speaker know the
truth of the matter about which he is going to speak? 

Phaedr. And yet, Socrates, I have heard that he who would be an orator
has nothing to do with true justice, but only with that which is likely
to be approved by the many who sit in judgment; nor with the truly
good or honourable, but only with opinion about them, and that from
opinion comes persuasion, and not from the truth. 

Soc. The words of the wise are not to be set aside; for there is 
probably
something in them; and therefore the meaning of this saying is not
hastily to be dismissed. 

Phaedr. Very true. 

Soc. Let us put the matter thus:-Suppose that I persuaded you to buy
a horse and go to the wars. Neither of us knew what a horse was like,
but I knew that you believed a horse to be of tame animals the one
which has the longest ears. 

Phaedr. That would be ridiculous. 

Soc. There is something more ridiculous coming:-Suppose, further,
that in sober earnest I, having persuaded you of this, went and composed
a speech in honour of an ass, whom I entitled a horse beginning: ""A
noble animal and a most useful possession, especially in war, and
you may get on his back and fight, and he will carry baggage or 
anything.""

Phaedr. How ridiculous! 

Soc. Ridiculous! Yes; but is not even a ridiculous friend better than
a cunning enemy? 

Phaedr. Certainly. 

Soc. And when the orator instead of putting an ass in the place of
a horse puts good for evil being himself as ignorant of their true
nature as the city on which he imposes is ignorant; and having studied
the notions of the multitude, falsely persuades them not about ""the
shadow of an ass,"" which he confounds with a horse, but about good
which he confounds with evily-what will be the harvest which rhetoric
will be likely to gather after the sowing of that seed? 

Phaedr. The reverse of good. 

Soc. But perhaps rhetoric has been getting too roughly handled by
us, and she might answer: What amazing nonsense you are talking! As
if I forced any man to learn to speak in ignorance of the truth! 
Whatever
my advice may be worth, I should have told him to arrive at the truth
first, and then come to me. At the same time I boldly assert that
mere knowledge of the truth will not give you the art of persuasion.

Phaedr. There is reason in the lady's defence of herself.

Soc. Quite true; if only the other arguments which remain to be brought
up bear her witness that she is an art at all. But I seem to hear
them arraying themselves on the opposite side, declaring that she
speaks falsely, and that rhetoric is a mere routine and trick, not
an art. Lo! a Spartan appears, and says that there never is nor ever
will be a real art of speaking which is divorced from the truth."
rhetoric an art of enchantment,,468,469,and what are these arguements,very true,261,unresolved,issue,major,Phaedr,Soc,,,,"Phaedr. And what are these arguments, Socrates? Bring them out that
we may examine them. 

Soc. Come out, fair children, and convince Phaedrus, who is the father
of similar beauties, that he will never be able to speak about anything
as he ought to speak unless he have a knowledge of philosophy. And
let Phaedrus answer you. 

Phaedr. Put the question. 

Soc. Is not rhetoric, taken generally, a universal art of enchanting
the mind by arguments; which is practised not only in courts and public
assemblies, but in private houses also, having to do with all matters,
great as well as small, good and bad alike, and is in all equally
right, and equally to be esteemed-that is what you have heard?

Phaedr. Nay, not exactly that; I should say rather that I have heard
the art confined to speaking and writing in lawsuits, and to speaking
in public assemblies-not extended farther. 

Soc. Then I suppose that you have only heard of the rhetoric of Nestor
and Odysseus, which they composed in their leisure hours when at Troy,
and never of the rhetoric of Palamedes? 

Phaedr. No more than of Nestor and Odysseus, unless Gorgias is your
Nestor, and Thrasymachus or Theodorus your Odysseus. 

Soc. Perhaps that is my meaning. But let us leave them. And do you
tell me, instead, what are plaintiff and defendant doing in a law
court-are they not contending? 

Phaedr. Exactly so. 

Soc. About the just and unjust-that is the matter in dispute?

Phaedr. Yes. 

Soc. And a professor of the art will make the same thing appear to
the same persons to be at one time just, at another time, if he is
so inclined, to be unjust? 

Phaedr. Exactly. 

Soc. And when he speaks in the assembly, he will make the same things
seem good to the city at one time, and at another time the reverse
of good? 

Phaedr. That is true. 

Soc. Have we not heard of the Eleatic Palamedes (Zeno), who has an
art of speaking by which he makes the same things appear to his hearers
like and unlike, one and many, at rest and in motion? 

Phaedr. Very true. "
the rhetorician must know differences,,469,,the art of disputation,,262,unresolved,issue,minor,,,,,,huh
,,,478,,what of that?,,unresolved,,,,,,,,
the virtue of analysis,,478 (bottom),480,all the great arts,"Nor, until they adopt",270,unresolved,story,major,Soc,Phaedr,,,,"Soc. All the great arts require discussion and high speculation about
the truths of nature; hence come loftiness of thought and completeness
of execution. And this, as I conceive, was the quality which, in 
addition
to his natural gifts, Pericles acquired from his intercourse with
Anaxagoras whom he happened to know. He was thus imbued with the higher
philosophy, and attained the knowledge of Mind and the negative of
Mind, which were favourite themes of Anaxagoras, and applied what
suited his purpose to the art of speaking. 

Phaedr. Explain. 

Soc. Rhetoric is like medicine. 

Phaedr. How so? 

Soc. Why, because medicine has to define the nature of the body and
rhetoric of the soul-if we would proceed, not empirically but 
scientifically,
in the one case to impart health and strength by giving medicine and
food in the other to implant the conviction or virtue which you desire,
by the right application of words and training. 

Phaedr. There, Socrates, I suspect that you are right. 

Soc. And do you think that you can know the nature of the soul 
intelligently
without knowing the nature of the whole? 

Phaedr. Hippocrates the Asclepiad says that the nature even of the body 
can only be understood as a whole.

Soc. Yes, friend, and he was right:-still, we ought not to be content 
with the name of Hippocrates, but to examine and see whether his 
argument agrees with his conception of nature.

Phaedr. I agree.

Soc. Then consider what truth as well as Hippocrates says about this or 
about any other nature. Ought we not to consider first whether that 
which we wish to learn and to teach is a simple or multiform thing, and 
if simple, then to enquire what power it has of acting or being acted 
upon in relation to other things, and if multiform, then to number the 
forms; and see first in the case of one of them, and then in. case of 
all of them, what is that power of acting or being acted upon which 
makes each and all of them to be what they are?

Phaedr. You may very likely be right, Socrates.

Soc. The method which proceeds without analysis is like the groping of 
a blind man. Yet, surely, he who is an artist ought not to admit of a 
comparison with the blind, or deaf. The rhetorician, who teaches his 
pupil to speak scientifically, will particularly set forth the nature 
of that being to which he addresses his speeches; and this, I conceive, 
to be the soul.

Phaedr. Certainly.

Soc. His whole effort is directed to the soul; for in that he seeks to 
produce conviction.

Phaedr. Yes.

Soc. Then clearly, Thrasymachus or any one else who teaches rhetoric in 
earnest will give an exact description of the nature of the soul; which 
will enable us to see whether she be single and same, or, like the 
body, multiform. That is what we should call showing the nature of the 
soul.

Phaedr. Exactly.

Soc. He will explain, secondly, the mode in which she acts or is acted 
upon.

Phaedr. True.

Soc. Thirdly, having classified men and speeches, and their kinds and 
affections, and adapted them to one another, he will tell the reasons 
of his arrangement, and show why one soul is persuaded by a particular 
form of argument, and another not.

Phaedr. You have hit upon a very good way.

Soc. Yes, that is the true and only way in which any subject can be set 
forth or treated by rules of art, whether in speaking or writing. But 
the writers of the present day, at whose feet you have sat, craftily, 
conceal the nature of the soul which they know quite well. Nor, until 
they adopt our method of reading and writing, can we admit that they 
write by rules of art?"
