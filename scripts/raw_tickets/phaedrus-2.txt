Socrates. My dear Phaedrus, whence come you, and whither are you going?

Phaedrus. I come from Lysias the son of Cephalus, and I am going to
take a walk outside the wall, for I have been sitting with him the
whole morning; and our common friend Acumenus tells me that it is
much more refreshing to walk in the open air than to be shut up in
a cloister. 

Soc. There he is right. Lysias then, I suppose, was in the town?

Phaedr. Yes, he was staying with Epicrates, here at the house of 
Morychus;
that house which is near the temple of Olympian Zeus. 

Soc. And how did he entertain you? Can I be wrong in supposing that
Lysias gave you a feast of discourse? 

Phaedr. You shall hear, if you can spare time to accompany me.
